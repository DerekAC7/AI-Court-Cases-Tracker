In particular, the development and use of such tools raises several issues relating to intellectual property, with potential concerns around infringements of IP rights in the inputs used to train them, as well as in output materials. There are also unresolved questions of the extent to which works generated by AI should be protected by IP rights. These issues are before the courts in various jurisdictions, and are also the subject of ongoing policy and regulatory discussions.",
