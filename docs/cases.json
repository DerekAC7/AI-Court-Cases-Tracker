    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Bartz v. Anthropic</b> — Anthropic recently chose to pay the largest known copyright settlement in history.\nSeveral weeks ago, we saw that the Bartz plaintiffs (book authors and rights-holders) and Anthropic had reached a proposed settlement of $1.5 Billion — the largest in U.S. copyright history. There are roughly 500,000 copyrighted works subject to the settlement, resulting is about $3,000 per work.\nRecall that Judge Alsup’s summary judgment ruling didn’t fault Anthropic for training its AI on copyrighted works. Rather, Alsup found that pirating copyrighted works to create a general-purpose digital library for Anthropic to use however it wanted was not “fair use.” In another case decided at that same time, Judge Vince Chhabria (in the same federal district) ruled that Meta’s acquisition of copyrighted materials through torrenting was not copyright infringement because the purpose of the acquisition was to train an AI system, which both Chhabria and Alsup found to be fair use. According to Alsup, Anthropic’s violation here is not training its AI, but taking hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works for whatever purpose it wanted. Arguably, if Anthropic had simply purchased the copyrighted works (likely for far less than $3,000 a copy) it would have been clear to train its AI however it chose — although, to be clear, Judge Chhabria would likely reach a different result.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Fair-use outcomes may hinge on record-specific market-harm proof.",

Anthropic’s primary concern appears to be that Plaintiffs will intermingle potentially infringing outputs from user-made prompts with its own prompts which were tailored to induce such output, but that it will not be evident to a fact-finder which is which. Anthropic requested confirmation that the October 12th order requires the same account information to be shown for all prompt-output pairs, while Concord maintains that Anthropic is attempting an end-run around the previous order. Then again, if Anthropic is so worried about Claude spitting out copyrighted content, maybe that’s Claude’s problem.\nThe parties also agreed to extend the deadline for expert reports and associated discovery by about one month, which the Court has adopted.",

According to Class Plaintiffs, Microsoft previously transferred portions of its Bing search index (which consists of collections of URLs and text from web pages) to OpenAI for use in training their LLMs. The Court found that the allegedly-transferred index data was no longer available due to constant updating and thus that anything produced would not be relevant.\nFinally, OpenAI and the News Plaintiffs remain at loggerheads over the potential production of 20 million chat logs. According to OpenAI, this is another effort to trample its users’ privacy in order to engage in a fishing expedition.

Second, they argued that the Order is not proportional to the needs of the case, because it would require OpenAI to make infrastructural changes to support the retention and would strain user trust in OpenAI. Finally, OpenAI argued that the preservation order was based on false premises, stating that OpenAI did not “destroy” any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events.\nOpenAI’s false-premises argument cites support from a non-public declaration, but it appears that OpenAI may be relying on a narrow distinction between “deleting” data (which it is arguing is needed to maintain customer trust) and “destroying” data which the News Plaintiffs could argue gives rise to adverse inference.",

We all figured we were heading here: UMG\nannounced\nthat it is going to license its music to Udio. Apparently, the plan is to have Udio continue as it is for some time, with various additional guardrails, while UMG and Udio work together to come up with a new service that is more acceptable to UMG (and is planned to be released in 2026). UMG says the new service will be a “licensed and protected environment.” We don’t know the details yet, and it is unclear what “protected” means (\ncan you download the music? Can you upload it elsewhere?\n). UMG is already out crowing about protecting its songwriters, saying that the “new agreements with Udio demonstrate our commitment to do what’s right by our artists and songwriters.” We’ll keep watch on the settlement details and see how much Anthropic money filters down to the artists themselves.\nWhile the press is already\nreporting the settlement\n, the case nonetheless moved forward last week, and since settlements are really never done until the dismissal is filed, here’s the update.\nAfter UMG Recordings filed its Amended Complaint to add a third claim for circumvention of technological measures, Uncharted Labs moved to dismiss. Its argument is that the difference between “access controls” (which seek to prevent improper access) and “copy controls” (which seek to prevent downloading and copying of material that is otherwise accessible) under 17 U.S.C. § 1201 bar this claim. UMG responded by arguing that the rolling cipher used by YouTube is an access control because it serves to prevent unauthorized applications from accessing YouTube.\nLast week, Uncharted Labs fired back in its reply briefing, accusing UMG of attacking a strawman and explaining that YouTube is unlike DVD players considered in prior cases, where content scrambling technologies (i.e., access controls) were used to prevent unlicensed players from accessing DVDs. It seems to us that UMG may have the better end of this comparison, as YouTube’s rolling cipher primarily serves to prevent third-party YouTube applications from accessing the otherwise publicly available content to circumvent advertisements. Nonetheless, UMG made the choice to characterize the rolling cipher as existing to prevent users from downloading content — a choice which Uncharted Labs has taken full advantage of in its recent briefing.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Settlement figures are emerging benchmarks for per-work valuation.",
