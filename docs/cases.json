    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Plaintiffs v. Anthropic</b> — Concord to depose Anthropic’s CEO, but will have to produce it’s prompts\n. The ongoing scuffle over Anthropic’s “motion for clarification of protective order” regarding material from the\nBartz\nlitigation has continued this week. Last week, Plaintiffs filed an objection to the request characterizing it as “an attempt to weaponize the Protective Order . . . and immunize Anthropic from future liability.” Plaintiffs pointed out that Anthropic was unable to identify any instances of alleged violation which would motivate its request for clarification. This week, Anthropic filed a reply in which it did not identify any express violation of the Protective Order but nonetheless argued that the distinctions Plaintiffs drew with certain cases suggested that they had violated the order.\nThis week, Magistrate Judge Susan Van Keulen granted Plaintiffs’ request to depose Anthropic founder and CEO Dario Amodei. These kinds of “apex” depositions are always hard fought, and this one counts as a major win for the plaintiffs assuming Judge Van Keulen upholds the ruling.\nFinally, Judge Van Keulen ruled on Anthropic’s request for information related to Plaintiffs’ investigation into its LLMs which yielded the reproduced lyrics included in their complaint. The order required the production of prompts and outputs submitted by investigators during the post-suit investigation, reasoning that Plaintiffs intended for their investigator, Michael Candore, to testify that the prompts used to bypass Anthropic’s guardrails were the sort that “anyone could do” and thus that Plaintiffs had placed the investigation at issue and waived privilege to some extent. However, Plaintiffs were not required to produce prompts crafted by counsel but not given to investigators or witnesses. Additionally, the order did not require the production of pre-suit investigatory prompts, reasoning that Plaintiffs had previously been required to provide statistical information (i.e., the number of attempts per positive result) that would suffice for cross-examination.",

    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>SDNY Multi-District Litigation</b> — Judge Stein dismisses several Ziff Davis claims, maintains most\n. This week, the Court ruled on OpenAI’s motion to dismiss claims by Plaintiff Ziff Davis, granting dismissal as to Ziff’s common law unjust enrichment and circumvention of technological measures claims, as well as granting in part OpenAI’s motion as to Ziff’s trademark dilution claim.\nFor unjust enrichment, Judge Stein explained that the rights protected by copyright and the common law cause of action were “equivalent” and thus that common law unjust enrichment was preempted. For circumvention of technological measures, Judge Stein did not find that a robots.txt file was an effective access control, comparing it to a “keep off the grass” sign in that it relies on readers to decide to comply rather than enforcing any kind of access control itself. With respect to trademark dilution, Judge Stein narrowed the dispute by eliminating certain alleged violations which involved marks that were insufficiently famous. Judge Stein also denied Ziff’s motion for leave to amend their complaint to add additional information related to their circumvention of technological measures claims, finding that the amendment would be futile.\nThe Class and News plaintiffs have also continued to oppose OpenAI’s efforts to reverse the magistrate judge’s order requiring OpenAI to produce 20 million chat logs and finding that OpenAI had waived privilege as to its reasons for deleting various records of its torrenting activities. Finally, the Court has stayed a number of proceedings for more minor defendants until it resolves summary judgment motions. Separately, OpenAI has moved to stay Ziff Davis’ case until summary judgment is resolved. These summary judgment motions represent another major decision point for AI copyright litigation, with the issue of fair use again at the forefront.

This week, the parties filed a joint motion requesting an approximately three-month extension to the close of fact discovery and all subsequent events, stating that this would allow discovery disputes to be resolved and avoid disputes regarding missing information. Judge Saylor granted the motion.\nThe big issue subject to the delay is UMG’s motion to amend its complaint. Over a month ago, UMG Recordings began pursuing the same amendments to its complaint in this matter as it did in\nUMG Recordings v. Uncharted Labs\n, adding additional claims regarding the circumvention of technological measures to download materials from YouTube. Suno then filed its sur-reply which argued that UMG has failed to distinguish between access controls and copy controls, stating that YouTube’s rolling cipher is the latter and thus that it is not a valid basis for circumvention claims. This rolling-cipher issue is an interesting technicality. If the rolling cipher prevents access to content, then circumventing it could be actionable under the DMCA. If all the rolling cipher does is prevent copying (or in this case, make it marginally more difficult), then the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions may not apply.\nOn the Suno settlement issue, Warner Bros. and its subsidiaries sent a letter to Judge Saylor stating that they had stipulated to voluntary dismissal with Suno, leaving UMG and other plaintiffs still in the case.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Settlement figures are emerging benchmarks for per-work valuation.",
