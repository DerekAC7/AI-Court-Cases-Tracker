    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Bartz v. Anthropic</b> — Anthropic chooses to pay the largest known copyright settlement in history.\nA few weeks ago, we saw that the Bartz plaintiffs (book authors and rights-holders) and Anthropic had reached a proposed settlement of $1.5 Billion — the largest in U.S. copyright history. There are roughly 500,000 copyrighted works subject to the settlement, resulting is about $3,000 per work.\nRecall that Judge Alsup’s summary judgment ruling didn’t fault Anthropic for training its AI on copyrighted works. Rather, Alsup found that pirating copyrighted works to create a general-purpose digital library for Anthropic to use however it wanted was not “fair use.” In another case decided at that same time, Judge Vince Chhabria (in the same federal district) ruled that Meta’s acquisition of copyrighted materials through torrenting was not copyright infringement because the purpose of the acquisition was to train an AI system, which both Chhabria and Alsup found to be fair use. According to Alsup, Anthropic’s violation here is not training its AI, but taking hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works for whatever purpose it wanted. Arguably, if Anthropic had simply purchased the copyrighted works (likely for far less than $3,000 a copy) it would have been clear to train its AI however it chose — although, to be clear, Judge Chhabria would likely reach a different result.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Fair-use outcomes may hinge on record-specific market-harm proof.",

The majority of disputes were denied either because the Court directed the parties to continue meeting and conferring or because the disputes had become moot following resolution by the parties. The Court withheld ruling on the collection of text and social media messages by OpenAI, the underlying motion for which is filed under seal but which appears to relate to the collection of information from OpenAI employees whom Plaintiffs suspect to have communicated regarding potentially infringing acts.\nThe Court also requested supplemental briefing on the ongoing dispute over whether OpenAI had waived privilege as to a number of documents related to OpenAI’s removal of the Books1 and Books2. In its latest ruling, the Court opined on the various privilege logs at issue, taking a stern hand to privilege allegations. A number of documents were ordered to be produced including logs from a Slack channel which, whether or not set up at the suggestion of legal counsel, did not\nde facto\ncontain privileged communication unless they independently were for the purpose of seeking legal advice.\nThe Court also ruled on a letter request by News Plaintiffs to be heard on their pending motion to strike Microsoft’s express license affirmative defenses at the upcoming October 8th discovery conference.

OpenAI has maintained its objections to this order.\nIn its Objection to Preservation Order, OpenAI raised three main arguments. First, that the preservation order does not serve a useful purpose because the idea that certain users attempt to “cover their tracks” is far-fetched. Second, they argued that the Order is not proportional to the needs of the case, because it would require OpenAI to make infrastructural changes to support the retention and would strain user trust in OpenAI. Finally, OpenAI argued that the preservation order was based on false premises, stating that OpenAI did not “destroy” any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events.\nOpenAI’s false-premises argument cites support from a non-public declaration, but it appears that OpenAI may be relying on a narrow distinction between “deleting” data (which it is arguing is needed to maintain customer trust) and “destroying” data which the News Plaintiffs could argue gives rise to adverse inference.",
