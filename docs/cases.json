This matter has been slow to start, with filings to date being largely administrative in nature. Late last year, Plaintiffs and Midjourney filed a joint stipulation to consolidate this action with the related action involving Warner Bros. Additionally, the case received a pretrial schedule several weeks ago marking August 21, 2026, as the deadline to file a report relating to the outcome of mediation. Deadlines resume afterward, with non-expert discovery closing on September 21, 2026, and expert discovery closing on November 9, 2026.\nOver a month ago, the Court scheduled an “informal discovery conference” for January 12th, asking the parties to provide a joint status update on January 8th. Although the parties provided such an update, the Court vacated the informal conference based on the parties’ statement that they had resolved the dispute. This week saw no new filings.",

    "headline": "Concord Music Group v. Anthropic",
    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Concord Music Group v. Anthropic</b> — No major substantive developments this past week.\nSeveral weeks ago, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to respond to Anthropic’s motion for relief from the Magistrate Judge’s order regarding investigative prompts and outputs. Anthropic had previously requested an order that Plaintiffs must produce the prompts which they used to investigate Claude’s ability to output lyrics. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen took a middle path in ruling on this motion, ordering the production of post-suit investigatory prompts and denying access to pre-suit prompts. Anthropic’s motion for relief argued that, in order to mount an effective defense, they needed to be able to distinguish prompts which were crafted by Plaintiffs from those which were the result of disinterested third parties.\nLast week, Plaintiffs submitted their response, arguing that Anthropic can already distinguish prompts from third parties from those crafted by Plaintiffs because they had already produced the prompt-output pairs from their pre- and post-suit investigations. Accordingly, they argue, there is no need to reveal their usernames and account information. In any event, they argued that the additional discovery that Anthropic requested was privileged as work product.\nAlso last week, the Court related the\nConcord Music Group, Inc. et al. v. Anthropic PBC, Dario Amodei, and Benjamin Mann\ncase to this one this week, finding (unsurprisingly, given the same parties’ involvement) that the two cases involved common legal and discovery issues.\nThis week included no notable new filings.",

The report also explained that Disney has been unsuccessful in locating a registered business in China for MiniMax and believes that it may be a “doing business as” name. Disney believes the most efficient approach is to wait until other defendants appear through counsel so that it can determine the proper identity of the various defendants.

As discussed last year, the parties and the Court agreed to relate the present case to another case filed against Apple by Susana Martinez-Conde and Stephen Macknick. More recently, the Court accepted another request to relate a case by Tasha Alexander against Apple. Based on a hearing held last week, the Court appointed William Dreher from Keller Rohrback and Rohit Nath from Susman Godfrey as interim co-lead counsel. This appointment will be in effect for one year, through the end of January 2027, with reappointment submissions scheduled for the last Friday of December.\nThis past week, the parties filed an amended complaint which included additional factual allegations regarding the ways in which Apple integrates its models into its products and the manner in which these models have impaired the market for Plaintiffs’ works. These later additions are likely setup for exactly the argument that Kadrey’s Judge Chhabria suggested the plaintiffs in that case should have made to overcome the fair use defense raised by Meta. In particular, the Hendrix class members discuss the manner in which generative AI outputs compete with human authors’ work product based on a 2025 working paper.",

    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Reddit v. Anthropic</b> — No major substantive developments this past week\n. As discussed previously, the main dispute in this case is presently whether it should be removed to federal court from California state court. There have been no new developments this week, but three weeks ago the Court issued a series of questions to both parties to assist with deciding that issue. Those questions included whether Reddit’s content falls within the subject matter of copyright under 17 U.S.C. §§ 102-103 and requests for legal precedent to clarify issues related to various common law claims raised by Reddit.\nThe following week, Reddit and Anthropic both submitted answers to the Court’s questions. Reddit clarified the nature of its dispute, explaining that although much of Reddit’s content—namely the posts, images, and comments users submit to Reddit—is subject to copyright, not all of the information Anthropic is alleged to have scraped is copyrightable. This non-copyrightable information includes factual information such as usernames, upvote/downvote counts, and the nesting of posts and comments. According to Reddit, it is this non-copyrightable information that is especially valuable to Anthropic because it represents statistical information about user preferences (e.g., via upvotes and downvotes). Reddit explained that its claims of breach of contract still reach non-copyrightable information because Anthropic was obligated not to scrape anything from Reddit.\nAnthropic appeared to dispute some of Reddit’s allegations regarding copyright, stating that a repository of online content (e.g., the link-sharing aspect of Reddit’s posts) may not fall within the Copyright Act’s protections. Additionally, Anthropic disputed whether any contract existed with Reddit, stating that Reddit’s User Agreement is only hyperlinked on the website but that users are not required to view it, which would be insufficient to establish an enforceable browse-wrap contract.",
