    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Bartz v. Anthropic</b> — Anthropic chooses to pay the largest known copyright settlement in history.\nA few weeks ago, we saw that the Bartz plaintiffs (book authors and rights-holders) and Anthropic had reached a proposed settlement of $1.5 Billion — the largest in U.S. copyright history. There are roughly 500,000 copyrighted works subject to the settlement, resulting is about $3,000 per work.\nRecall that Judge Alsup’s summary judgment ruling didn’t fault Anthropic for training its AI on copyrighted works. Rather, Alsup found that pirating copyrighted works to create a general-purpose digital library for Anthropic to use however it wanted was not “fair use.” In another case decided at that same time, Judge Vince Chhabria (in the same federal district) ruled that Meta’s acquisition of copyrighted materials through torrenting was not copyright infringement because the purpose of the acquisition was to train an AI system, which both Chhabria and Alsup found to be fair use. According to Alsup, Anthropic’s violation here is not training its AI, but taking hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works for whatever purpose it wanted. Arguably, if Anthropic had simply purchased the copyrighted works (likely for far less than $3,000 a copy) it would have been clear to train its AI however it chose — although, to be clear, Judge Chhabria would likely reach a different result.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Fair-use outcomes may hinge on record-specific market-harm proof.",

Anthropic</b> — The Court is displeased with the parties.\nAs mentioned last week, the parties have filed letters related to numerous new discovery disputes as the close of fact discovery approaches—too many, it would seem. On October 5th, Magistrate Judge Susan Van Keulen issued a show cause order stating “[o]bviously, the Parties have lost the ability to manage[] discovery in an efficient manner in violation of Rule 1 and lost sight of the proportionality mandate of Rule 26.” Counsel for the parties were required to appear on October 10 to explain why both sides should not be sanctioned and to reach potential compromise. Although the Court held its show cause hearing as scheduled, the results of that hearing are not yet apparent in the docket.\nNonetheless, the Court ruled on a few discovery disputes. Concord’s request to depose Anthropic founder Dario Amodei was denied, as were Concord’s requests to de-designate raw training text extracted from pirated books. The Court did, however, order additional custodial searches by Anthropic. The Court also denied Anthropic’s motion to dismiss Concord’s amended indirect copyright infringement and CMI remove claims, which had previously been dismissed with leave to amend. Finally, the Court extended the deadline for close of fact discovery to November 12th. Hopefully this gives the parties enough time to resolve their disputes without the need to resort to motion practice, as the Court made clear that it was “not inclined to grant a further extension.”",

OpenAI has maintained its objections to this order.\nIn its Objection to Preservation Order, OpenAI raised three main arguments. First, that the preservation order does not serve a useful purpose because the idea that certain users attempt to “cover their tracks” is far-fetched. Second, they argued that the Order is not proportional to the needs of the case, because it would require OpenAI to make infrastructural changes to support the retention and would strain user trust in OpenAI. Finally, OpenAI argued that the preservation order was based on false premises, stating that OpenAI did not “destroy” any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events.\nOpenAI’s false-premises argument cites support from a non-public declaration, but it appears that OpenAI may be relying on a narrow distinction between “deleting” data (which it is arguing is needed to maintain customer trust) and “destroying” data which the News Plaintiffs could argue gives rise to adverse inference.",
