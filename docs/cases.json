    "summary": "**Summaries:** **Kadrey et al. v Meta - N.D. Cal rules AI training fair use.** On June 25, Judge Chhabria granted summary judgment on fair use for AI training to Meta finding that 1) using plaintiffs’ books to train Meta’s LLM was highly transformative, and 2) plaintiffs are not entitled to the market for licensing for AI training. But Judge Chhabria noted that his decision was limited to the specific record of the case, and that in many circumstances training would not be fair use. He indicated that the order likely would have been different if plaintiffs had pled harm to the market for their original works, and even criticized Judge Alsup’s Bartz order for brushing aside market harm concerns.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Future pleadings may be more successful if they focus on harm to the market for the original works and not only on the harm to the market for training licenses.",
