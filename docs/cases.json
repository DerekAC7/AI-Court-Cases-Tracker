    "summary": "**Summaries:** **Bartz v Anthropic – N.D. Cal rules AI training fair use.** On June 23, Judge Alsup granted partial summary judgment to Anthropic, ruling that 1) training Claude on plaintiffs’ books was “exceedingly transformative” and fair use, and 2) digitizing purchased physical books for Anthropic’s central library was also fair use. But the court declined to extend the fair use ruling to Anthropic downloading over 7 million pirated books for its central library, saying that such piracy is “inherently, irredeemably infringing” regardless of whether the copies are later put to a fair use. This issue will proceed to trial.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Even where training is fair use, developers may still face significant liability for downloading pirated content.",

Cal rules AI training fair use.** On June 25, Judge Chhabria granted summary judgment on fair use for AI training to Meta finding that 1) using plaintiffs’ books to train Meta’s LLM was highly transformative, and 2) plaintiffs are not entitled to the market for licensing for AI training. But Judge Chhabria noted that his decision was limited to the specific record of the case, and that in many circumstances training would not be fair use. He indicated that the order likely would have been different if plaintiffs had pled harm to the market for their original works, and even criticized Judge Alsup’s Bartz order for brushing aside market harm concerns.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Future pleadings may be more successful if they focus on harm to the market for the original works and not only on the harm to the market for training licenses.",
