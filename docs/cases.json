    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Bartz v. Anthropic</b> — Anthropic chooses to pay the largest known copyright settlement in history.\nA few weeks ago, we saw that the Bartz plaintiffs (book authors and rights-holders) and Anthropic had reached a proposed settlement of $1.5 Billion — the largest in U.S. copyright history. There are roughly 500,000 copyrighted works subject to the settlement, resulting is about $3,000 per work.\nRecall that Judge Alsup’s summary judgment ruling didn’t fault Anthropic for training its AI on copyrighted works. Rather, Alsup found that pirating copyrighted works to create a general-purpose digital library for Anthropic to use however it wanted was not “fair use.” In another case decided at that same time, Judge Vince Chhabria (in the same federal district) ruled that Meta’s acquisition of copyrighted materials through torrenting was not copyright infringement because the purpose of the acquisition was to train an AI system, which both Chhabria and Alsup found to be fair use. According to Alsup, Anthropic’s violation here is not training its AI, but taking hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works for whatever purpose it wanted. Arguably, if Anthropic had simply purchased the copyrighted works (likely for far less than $3,000 a copy) it would have been clear to train its AI however it chose — although, to be clear, Judge Chhabria would likely reach a different result.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Fair-use outcomes may hinge on record-specific market-harm proof.",

Nonetheless,\nThe Times\nstated that it would — once its inspection of logs had been completed — identify infringing outputs that it intends to rely on at trial.\nOpenAI also filed an objection to an earlier ruling which denied them access to records of\nThe Times\n’ internal use of LLMs. The objection argues that such records are crucial to rebutting\nThe Times\n’ expected arguments against the transformative use of LLMs (fair use factor one) and in support of market harm caused by LLMs (fair use factor four). OpenAI requested oral argument on their objection.\nOpenAI further moved to compel the production of documents related to Ziff Davis’ training of internally-developed AI models, pointing to documents showing that CNET (one of the named plaintiffs) had developed an “internally designed AI engine” for writing articles. Ziff Davis responded by stating that they were still conferring regarding production of such documents and that OpenAI’s motion was premature.\nThe News Plaintiffs countered with their own set of motions.\nThe Times\nhas continued demanding that Microsoft produce any licenses on which it intends to rely for its express license defense. All News Plaintiffs also joined in a motion demanding that OpenAI produce 20 million records of ChatGPT-consumer chat logs from December 2022 to November 2024.

OpenAI has maintained its objections to this order.\nIn its Objection to Preservation Order, OpenAI raised three main arguments. First, that the preservation order does not serve a useful purpose because the idea that certain users attempt to “cover their tracks” is far-fetched. Second, they argued that the Order is not proportional to the needs of the case, because it would require OpenAI to make infrastructural changes to support the retention and would strain user trust in OpenAI. Finally, OpenAI argued that the preservation order was based on false premises, stating that OpenAI did not “destroy” any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events.\nOpenAI’s false-premises argument cites support from a non-public declaration, but it appears that OpenAI may be relying on a narrow distinction between “deleting” data (which it is arguing is needed to maintain customer trust) and “destroying” data which the News Plaintiffs could argue gives rise to adverse inference.",
