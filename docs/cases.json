    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Bartz v. Anthropic</b> — Anthropic chooses to pay the largest known copyright settlement in history — but so far, the Court won’t let them!\nA few weeks ago, we saw that the Bartz plaintiffs (book authors and rights-holders) and Anthropic had reached a proposed settlement of $1.5 Billion. There are roughly 500,000 copyrighted works subject to the settlement, resulting is about $3,000 per work. Although this is certainly an historic and watershed moment in AI training litigation, we need to put it in context. But last week, Judge Alsup refused to approve the settlement. The Judge instead demanded more information about the settlement. So will it happen? Won’t it? Stay tuned for more.\nBut recall that Judge Alsup’s summary judgment ruling didn’t fault Anthropic for training its AI on copyrighted works. Rather, Alsup found that pirating copyrighted works to create a general-purpose digital library for Anthropic to use however it wanted was not “fair use.” In another case decided that same week several weeks ago, Judge Vince Chhabria (in the same federal district) ruled that Meta’s acquisition of copyrighted materials through torrenting was not copyright infringement because the purpose of the acquisition was to train an AI system, which both Chhabria and Alsup found to be fair use. According to Alsup, Anthropic’s violation here is not training its AI, but taking hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works for whatever purpose it wanted. Arguably, if Anthropic had simply purchased the copyrighted works (likely for far less than $3,000 a copy) it would have been clear to train its AI however it chose — although, to be clear, Judge Chhabria would likely reach a different result.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Fair-use outcomes may hinge on record-specific market-harm proof.",

OpenAI has maintained its objections to this order.\nIn its Objection to Preservation Order, OpenAI raised three main arguments. First, that the preservation order does not serve a useful purpose because the idea that certain users attempt to “cover their tracks” is far-fetched. Second, they argued that the Order is not proportional to the needs of the case, because it would require OpenAI to make infrastructural changes to support the retention and would strain user trust in OpenAI. Finally, OpenAI argued that the preservation order was based on false premises, stating that OpenAI did not “destroy” any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events.\nOpenAI’s false-premises argument cites support from a non-public declaration, but it appears that OpenAI may be relying on a narrow distinction between “deleting” data (which it is arguing is needed to maintain customer trust) and “destroying” data which the News Plaintiffs could argue gives rise to adverse inference.",
