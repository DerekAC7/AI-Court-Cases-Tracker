Four weeks ago, Plaintiffs and Midjourney filed a joint stipulation to consolidate this action with the related action involving Warner Bros. Additionally, two weeks ago, the Court ordered that the case be referred to a private mediator, with the alternative dispute resolution proceeding to be completed by August 19, 2026.\nNonetheless, the case is moving forward in the interim according to the pretrial schedule issued last week, which marks August 21, 2026 as the deadline to file a report relating to the outcome of mediation. Deadlines resume afterward, with non-expert discovery closing on September 21, 2026 and expert discovery closing November 9, 2026.\nNote also that, following consolidation with the Warner Bros. case, this entry now tracks the progress of that dispute as well. This week it was also announced that Netflix intends to acquire Warner Bros. for over $80 billion. How, if at all, that will influence the case is so far unclear.",

However, a few notable events did occur. In particular, OpenAI filed a joint stipulation with Plaintiffs to amend its Answers to the complaints filed by the various news Plaintiffs to remove their affirmative defenses claiming that OpenAI reasonably believed that the alleged acts were not infringement due to the fair use doctrine, because the alleged acts were\nde minimis\n, or because copyright claims were otherwise barred. It is not readily apparent why OpenAI has chosen to remove these defenses, but OpenAI still maintains its affirmative defenses that any alleged copyright\nwas\nfair use.\nAdditionally, OpenAI’s motion for reconsideration following the Magistrate Judge’s order that they must produce 20 Million ChatGPT logs was denied. In denying its motion, Judge Stein found that OpenAI’s allegations that these logs were largely not relevant to the present disputes was not well-established and that OpenAI’s prior arguments regarding their relevance cut against their current arguments. The Court also pointed to OpenAI’s existing methods for anonymizing the outputs of its ChatGPT, alongside the additional protections afforded by the protective order in this matter, mitigated the privacy concerns that OpenAI raised.\nFinally, Magistrate Judge Wang granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the re-collection of text and social media messages by OpenAI’s higher-ups, finding that personal counsel for Sam Altman and Greg Brockman had essentially performed an initial “privacy” review before OpenAI’s counsel performed a responsiveness review, which resulted in over-redaction of materials.",
