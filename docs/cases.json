    "summary": "<b>Summaries:</b> <b>Bartz v Anthropic</b> — Anthropic pays the largest known copyright settlement in history!\n2 weeks ago, we saw that the Bartz plaintiffs (book authors and rights-holders) and Anthropic had reached a proposed settlement, but we did not know any of the terms. Last Friday, the world found out that the proposed settlement is $1.5 Billion! There are roughly 500,000 copyrighted works subject to the settlement, resulting is about $3,000 per work. Although this is certainly an historic and watershed moment in AI training litigation, we need to put it in context. And, today is the day Judge Alsup is expected to approve the settlement.\nRecall that Judge Alsup’s summary judgment ruling didn’t fault Anthropic for training its AI on copyrighted works. Rather, Alsup found that pirating copyrighted works to create a general-purpose digital library for Anthropic to use however it wanted was not “fair use.” In another case decided that same week several weeks ago, Judge Vince Chhabria (in the same federal district) ruled that Meta’s acquisition of copyrighted materials through torrenting was not copyright infringement because the purpose of the acquisition was to train an AI system, which both Chhabria and Alsup found to be fair use. According to Alsup, Anthropic’s violation here is not training its AI, but taking hundreds of thousands of copyrighted works for whatever purpose it wanted. Arguably, if Anthropic had simply purchased the copyrighted works (likely for far less than $3,000 a copy) it would have been clear to train its AI however it chose — although, to be clear, Judge Chhabria would likely reach a different result.\nIt remains to be seen how or whether courts will try to synthesize Judge Chhabria’s ruling in\nKadrey\nwith Alsup’s ruling in\nBartz\n. But for now, the\nBartz\nauthors can claim a well-earned victory. Despite the complex background, we remain hopeful that this massive settlement will encourage other AI companies to compensate authors for the use of their copyrighted works. And we expect they will.<br><br><b>Key takeaway:</b> Fair-use outcomes may hinge on record-specific market-harm proof.",

As we reported two weeks ago, the most recent movement was Midjourney’s answer where Midjourney likened the process of training an LLM to the process of a human being learning, echoing the reasoning underlying the fair use defenses of other AI companies. At the same time, Midjourney described its product as a tool used by artists. Midjourney suggested that, to the extent that any produced images infringed Disney’s copyrights, they were only created at the instruction of its users. Midjourney raised a particularly interesting affirmative defense: unclean hands. Apparently Disney’s own purported use of training an AI model on copyrighted works precludes Disney from enforcing its own copyrights. We suspect that the unclean hands defense may be more marketing than lawyering, but we’ll see.",

Ziff Davis filed its reply memorandum of law opposing OpenAI’s motion to dismiss. OpenAI has alleged that Ziff Davis’ robots.txt (includes information to inform web crawlers of whether a site owner permits scraping) was not a sufficient technological measure to give rise to a DMCA claim. OpenAI also argued that Ziff Davis’ unjust enrichment claims were preempted and that its trademark claims were not sufficiently plead. Ziff Davis maintained that its claims regarding circumvention of its robots.txt configuration were actionable under the DMCA; that its unjust enrichment claims involved non-copyright interests, avoiding pre-emption; and that it had sufficiently alleged the fame of its trademarks to establish a claim of trademark infringement.\nOpenAI and Microsoft also filed reply briefs in support of their motions to strike portions of the class plaintiffs’ complaint. They contend that the addition of models other than GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo is improper and that the case should be limited to the originally-plead models. Additionally, they argue that the addition of copyright claims based on the downloading of copyrighted materials (rather than their use for model training) should be disallowed.\nFinally, the class plaintiffs filed a motion seeking in camera review of a number of OpenAI documents, arguing that they were improperly withheld as privileged.

OpenAI has maintained its objections to this order.\nIn its Objection to Preservation Order, OpenAI raised three main arguments. First, that the preservation order does not serve a useful purpose because the idea that certain users attempt to “cover their tracks” is far-fetched. Second, they argued that the Order is not proportional to the needs of the case, because it would require OpenAI to make infrastructural changes to support the retention and would strain user trust in OpenAI. Finally, OpenAI argued that the preservation order was based on false premises, stating that OpenAI did not “destroy” any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events.\nOpenAI’s false-premises argument cites support from a non-public declaration, but it appears that OpenAI may be relying on a narrow distinction between “deleting” data (which it is arguing is needed to maintain customer trust) and “destroying” data which the News Plaintiffs could argue gives rise to adverse inference.",
