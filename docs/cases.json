This particular matter has been slow to start, with largely administrative filings thus far. Late last year, Plaintiffs and Midjourney filed a joint stipulation to consolidate this action with the related action involving Warner Bros. Additionally, the case received a pretrial schedule several weeks ago marking August 21, 2026, as the deadline to file a report relating to the outcome of mediation. Deadlines resume afterward, with non-expert discovery closing on September 21, 2026, and expert discovery closing on November 9, 2026.\nThis week, the Court scheduled an “informal discovery conference” for January 12th, asking the parties to provide a joint status update on January 8th. Check back soon to see how the case develops in 2026.",

Months ago, Disney, Universal, and Warner Bros. filed suit against AI companies offering video generation products which is similar to the one filed by Disney against Midjourney. The case has been assigned to Judge Stanley Blumenfeld and Magistrate Judge Charles Eick.\nAlthough the case has seen little movement, Judge Stanley Blumenfeld issued an order to show cause in the last week of 2025 in which he noted that the complaint had been served more than 90 days ago and yet Disney had not yet filed proof of service. Disney was ordered to explain why the case should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution by December 29th. Disney responded on Christmas Eve, explaining that it has made efforts to serve Defendants but has been unsuccessful due to difficulties serving foreign parties. Disney also noted that Rule 4(m) (which sets forth the requirement to serve defendants within 90 days) has been found not to apply where all defendants are foreign companies.",

The Court is having none of Anthropic’s supposed confusion and accusations. Anthropic had filed a motion seeking clarification of the Protective Order and intimated that Plaintiffs have misused confidential information obtained during this litigation and the\nBartz\ncase, in which the same lawyers appeared. Anthropic did not identify any concrete examples of misuse but instead expressed concern and requested that the Court clarify what kinds of “use” are prohibited. In its order denying the motion, the Court noted that a number of cases cited during briefing were relevant to the meaning of “use” but otherwise declined to modify the scope of the Protective Order.\nOther squabbles between the parties have also continued this week. Anthropic filed a motion for relief from Magistrate Judge van Keulen’s recent order which denied Anthropic access to pre-suit prompts but required production of post-suit prompts. They argue that this deprives them of the ability to delineate between third party prompts and Plaintiff-constructed prompts, the latter of which they say cannot show secondary liability because they were initiated by Plaintiffs themselves.",

OpenAI filed its answer to Ziff Davis’ First Amended Complaint—which Microsoft had answered weeks ago—though the Answer contains few notable entries. OpenAI largely denied Ziff’s additional allegations and advanced the same affirmative defenses as Microsoft.\nAdditionally, several of the News Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Microsoft to produce approximately 8.1 million output logs containing News Plaintiffs’ names and web domains from Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) in a searchable format. The News Plaintiffs have been seeking this discovery for some time and state in their motion that Microsoft is in a position to produce the logs but has delayed production as a litigation tactic. Plaintiffs state that these logs are relevant because they provide evidence that can be used to prove direct infringement and to investigate so-called “pink-slime” outputs—low quality journalistic text that could evidence market harm to News Plaintiffs.\nFinally, Ziff Davis requested an extension to file an opposition to OpenAI’s motion to stay. Although the Court granted the motion, extending the response deadline to January 8th and reply deadline to January 15th, it is still not clear whether Ziff Davis will manage to hang on or be sidelined while the Court resolves summary judgment for Plaintiffs that have been involved in the litigation for longer.",
